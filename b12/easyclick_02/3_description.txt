Many people believe hard work automatically leads to recognition and higher pay. But others argue visibility — speaking up in meetings, networking, showing results publicly — matters more than effort happening quietly behind the scenes.

This creates a real tension: should success come from pure performance, or from strategic self-promotion?

Some workers feel frustrated watching louder personalities move ahead faster. Others believe visibility is simply part of modern professional skills, not manipulation.

The truth may depend on industry, company culture, and personality style — but everyone has an opinion based on what they’ve experienced.

Be honest: have you ever felt invisible despite working hard? Or have you seen confident communicators accelerate their careers even with average output?

Pick a side and defend it. No middle ground today.
