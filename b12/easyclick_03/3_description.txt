For years, people were told to follow passion and money would follow. Now many feel that advice ignored financial realities like rent, inflation, and stability. Others still believe fulfillment matters more than income because burnout from high-paying jobs can be just as costly emotionally.

So which matters more today — loving what you do or earning enough to live comfortably without constant stress?

Some argue passion becomes easier when financial pressure disappears. Others say passion without financial growth eventually creates resentment.

Think about your own priorities. Have they changed over time? What did younger you believe compared to now?

Choose one side and explain why — and yes, “balance” isn’t an option today.
