Somewhere along the way, dating became very… undefined.

No labels. No expectations. No conversations about direction. Just vibes.

For some people, that feels freeing — less pressure, less rushing, more organic connection. But for others, it creates confusion that slowly turns into emotional exhaustion.

Because when everything stays "casual," nobody has to be accountable. Nobody has to risk rejection by saying what they actually want.

And maybe that’s why so many people feel stuck in situationships that never move forward but also never end.

Is going with the flow genuinely healthy… or is it just avoidance dressed up as emotional maturity?

Some say labels ruin natural connection. Others say clarity creates safety.

Be honest — have you ever stayed "chill" even though you secretly wanted more?
