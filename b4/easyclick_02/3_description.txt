Many people say dating feels harder today — less consistency, more mixed signals, more emotional distance.

But others argue that people simply stopped tolerating bare minimum behavior.

So what actually changed?

Maybe effort didn’t disappear — maybe people just stopped pretending small gestures equal genuine investment.

Or maybe swipe culture made people less patient because new options always exist.

Some believe romance is dying. Others believe boundaries are rising.

Which side are you on?

Is effort rare now… or are we just seeing relationships more clearly than before?
