Texting has become one of the biggest sources of overthinking in modern dating.

Short replies, delayed responses, inconsistent effort — people debate endlessly whether these are personality traits or signals of disinterest.

Some believe communication style differences are normal. Others believe effort shows through consistency, regardless of personality.

Is "bad at texting" real… or just a polite excuse?

And how much meaning should we attach to digital communication anyway?

Maybe the deeper question is whether clarity should feel effortless when someone genuinely cares.
