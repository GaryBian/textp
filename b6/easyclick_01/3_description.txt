Some people believe timing can truly ruin a good connection — careers, emotional maturity, distance, life stages. Others argue that when two people are genuinely right for each other, they make the timing work no matter what.

So which is it?

Is "wrong time" a real life obstacle… or a softer way of saying someone wasn’t fully committed?

Many relationships end with unfinished feelings, and the idea of timing becomes a comforting explanation. But is it always honest?

Maybe timing matters because people grow at different speeds. Or maybe the right relationship naturally adapts to chaos instead of collapsing under it.

Have you ever met someone who felt perfect — but life circumstances made it impossible?

Or did you later realize timing was just an excuse for incompatibility?

This one always splits opinions.
