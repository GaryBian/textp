Modern dating turned simple communication into strategy.

Some believe initiating shows confidence and genuine interest. Others say balanced effort matters — and always being the one to reach out can feel one-sided.

Is there really a rule about who texts first, or is that just social pressure?

Maybe the deeper issue isn’t who starts conversations, but whether effort feels mutual over time.

Still, people interpret texting patterns as emotional signals — which is why this debate never ends.

If someone likes you, should you feel equal energy… or is effort naturally uneven at times?
