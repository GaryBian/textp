This post encourages viewers to share how they define digital respect and what actions make them feel secure or uncomfortable. Invite commenters to discuss whether context matters, such as liking a friend’s post versus a stranger’s content. Encourage respectful discussion by acknowledging that online behavior often reflects personal values, cultural norms, and previous experiences with trust. You can also prompt conversations about transparency, communication, and setting expectations early in relationships.
